    <p>The <b>Akatsuki</b> is a group of rogue ninja in the world of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto" >Naruto</a></i>. They are known for their powerful members and unique red-cloud cloaks. The members of the Akatsuki are ninja who have abandoned their villages, and are considered by their former homes to be S-class criminals, the most powerful and wanted ninja in the Naruto universe. Aside from an attempt by members <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itachi_Uchiha" >Itachi Uchiha</a> and Kisame Hoshigaki to capture <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Kurama" >Kurama</a> (the Nine-Tailed fox sealed within Naruto Uzumaki), the Akatsuki is not prominently featured in Part I.In Part II, they take a more active role, capturing Gaara and extracting the one-tailed tanuki, Shukaku, from his body, as well as progressively capturing the remaining Tailed Beasts. Kishimoto called the Akatsuki's members antiheroes as he wished to expand their backgrounds as much as the ones from the series' protagonists, contrasting them with other types of villains.</p>
    
    <p><h3>Some of the notable members include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <h2><b><u>Itachi Uchiha</u></b></h2>

Itachi Uchiha (うちは イタチ, Uchiha Itachi) is a former ninja of Konohagakure and the partner of Kisame Hoshigaki. Though having spent his early youth as the prodigy of the Uchiha clan, Itachi is treated as a villain for much of the series. He is initially portrayed as being solely responsible for the killing of his entire clan and family, sparing only his brother, Sasuke Uchiha, with the explanation that he was testing his abilities.</p>
        <h2><b><u>Nagato</u></b></h2>

Nagato (長門), primarily known under the alias of Pain (ペイン, Pein), is the recognized leader of the Akatsuki and partner of Konan, with Obito acting as his benefactor. The "Pain" most often seen in the series is the Deva Path, which is actually Nagato's deceased friend, Yahiko (弥彦), one of six animated corpses collectively known as "The Six Paths of Pain" (ペイン六道, Pein Rikudō), all controlled by Nagato and using one sixth of his full power.</p>
        <h2><b><u>Kisame Hoshigaki</u></b></h2>

       <p>The explosive artist. Deidara (デイダラ) is a former ninja of Iwagakure, having left the village after bombing it. He was a terrorist bomber-for-hire before Itachi Uchiha forced him to join the Akatsuki. Though he came to embrace the organization, Deidara still holds a grudge against Itachi and all other Uchiha throughout the series, as he feels their Sharingan eyes "look down on his artwork". Upon joining the Akatsuki, he is partnered with Sasori, who is replaced by Tobi after his death.</p>
       <h2><b><u>Sasori</u></b></h2>

       <p>Sasori (蠍), primarily known as "Sasori of the Red Sand" (赤砂の蠍, Akasuna no Sasori), is a former ninja of Sunagakure and partner of Deidara. When he was a child, Sasori's parents were killed by Sakumo Hatake, also known as the White Fang of Konoha, leaving him in the care of his grandmother, Chiyo, who taught Sasori the art of puppetry to cheer him up after his loss, which he refined to fit his needs over the years.</p>
